# MultipleAccessProtocols
This project is a code simulation of network multiple access protocols. Multiple Access protocols provide a situation which minimizes probablity of collision. And users in the network can send data simultaneously. The implemented protocols are: Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Dynamic Time Division Multiple Access (D-TDMA) and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). For more details check out the project document.
